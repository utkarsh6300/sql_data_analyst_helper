"""Prepared statements and cursors: PREPARE, EXECUTE, DEALLOCATE,
DECLARE, FETCH, MOVE, CLOSE.

Split out of the full PostgreSQL statement sweep
(see tests/integration/security/ sibling files for the other command
families) so a failure in one family doesn't require scrolling past the
other ~170 parametrized cases to find it. See the module docstring in
git history of test_postgres_statement_sweep.py, or
docs/02-security-model.md, for why this sweep exists: it proves the
read-only pass rejects every PostgreSQL command that is not a pure read --
not by naming each command's AST node individually, but as a consequence of
`ALLOWED_ROOT_TYPES` in `passes/readonly.py` accepting only
Select/SetOperation/Subquery/Paren at the root.

Each statement is minimal, often-nonsensical SQL (placeholder object names
like `t1`, `role1`, `fn1`) -- the read-only pass runs before catalog
resolution and inspects AST node shape only, so nothing here needs to
reference a real object. Several of these statements don't even parse into
a dedicated sqlglot node (sqlglot falls back to a generic `Command`), which
is fine: `Command` is itself denied, and a `PARSE_ERROR` is just as much a
rejection as `NON_SELECT_STATEMENT` is. What matters, and what every case
below asserts, is that none of these commands ever reaches name resolution
or authorization -- reaching those passes would mean pass ordering was
violated, which is a correctness bug in this package regardless of what the
query does.
